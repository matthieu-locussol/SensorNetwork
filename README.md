## Description

SensorNetwork is a network of sensors and visualization interfaces.

As part of the neOCampus project from [Paul Sabatier University](http://www.univ-tlse3.fr/), I had to realize a software to gather, visualize and interpret real-time datas from different types of sensors located on the University campus.

_Project carried out as part of my third year at [Paul Sabatier Universsity](http://www.univ-tlse3.fr/)._
